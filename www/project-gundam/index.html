            This project was developed as a part of my third year (September 2023 to March 2024) team project in university. 
            As such, the source code is on a private GitLab instance and is not public.
            </br></br>
            Project Gundam takes users on a short walk around the University of Glasgows campus by use of a compass. 
            They will find giant Gundam models from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a> super-imposed using augmented reality at several locations.
