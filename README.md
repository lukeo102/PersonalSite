# Introduction
This is my personal website to show off my works.

## How it works?
This is static site generator I made myself. 

I add or remove entries from the json files in the config directory and on push to GitHub it will run an action that regenerates the html files in the www folder. 

Finally, it will trigger Cloudflare to push my changes to Cloudflare pages.
